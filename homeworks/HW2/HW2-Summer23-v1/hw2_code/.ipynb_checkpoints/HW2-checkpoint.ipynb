      "1 - ECE: A multifunctional platform based on the microhotplate was developed for applications including a Pirani vacuum gauge, temperature, and gas sensor. It consisted of a tungsten microhotplate and an on-chip operational amplifier. The platform was fabricated in a standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process. A tungsten plug in standard CMOS process was specially designed as the serpentine resistor for the microhotplate, acting as both heater and thermister. With the sacrificial layer technology, the microhotplate was suspended over the silicon substrate with a 340 nm gap. The on-chip operational amplifier provided a bias current for the microhotplate. This platform has been used to develop different kinds of sensors. The first one was a Pirani vacuum gauge ranging from 10(-1) to 10(5) Pa. The second one was a temperature sensor ranging from -20 to 70 degrees C. The third one was a thermal-conductivity gas sensor, which could distinguish gases with different thermal conductivities in constant gas pressure and environment temperature. In the fourth application, with extra fabrication processes including the deposition of gas-sensitive film, the platform was used as a metal-oxide gas sensor for the detection of gas concentration.\n",

In this study, the performance of the feed forward neural network (FFNN) was compared with radial basis neural network (RBNN) in modelling the productivity of masonry crews. A variety of input factors were incorporated and analysed. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and correlation coefficient (R) were used to evaluate model performance. Research results indicated that the neural computing techniques could be successfully employed in modelling crew productivity. It was also found that successful models could be developed with different combinations of input factors, and several of the models which excluded one or more input factors turned out to be better than the baseline models. Based on the MAPE values obtained for the models, the RBNN technique was found to be better than the FFNN technique, although both slightly overestimated the masons' productivity.\n",

The loss of information through this process is negligible, and the difference in the accuracy is very minimal. \n",

    "Word embeddings are a type of word representation that allows words with similar meaning to have a similar representation. The Global Vectors for Word Representation, or GloVe, algorithm is an extension to the word2vec method for efficiently learning word vectors, developed by Pennington, et al. at Stanford. GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words. Training is performed on aggregated global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus, and the resulting representations showcase interesting linear substructures of the word vector space. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the provided **glove.6B.50d.txt** file for loading the pre-trained embeddings for the vocabulary. You will be transforming the Web of Science data to glove embeddings by taking the mean of the glove embeddings of all words in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **glove.py** file complete the following function:\n",
    "  * <strong>transform</strong>\n",
    "  \n",
    "Here is an example of taking the mean of the glove embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sentence : 'I love NLP Homework',\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-1** : We find the embeddings to each word using the provided glove model. Here using **glove.6B.50d.txt**, we get the embeddings of each word : I, love, NLP, Homework separately. All of them are a vector of shape (50,).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-2** : We stack these embeddings and transform it to a numpy array. After this step, we get a shape of : (4,50) because there are 4 words (tokens) in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-3** : Next, we will be taking a mean of this array along the 0th dimension. We get the shape as : (1,50). This is the final glove embeddings for our sentence which can be used for further classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us take a look at the glove embeddings for few words and their visualization in a 2D space."
